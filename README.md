## Chatting with Your Own Database

We use natural language (english) to query our database and CSV. LangChain integrates with GPT to convert natural language to the corresponding SQL statements, or pandas command, which is then executed to return a natural language response.

LangChain is a fantastic tool for developers looking to build AI systems using the variety of LLMs (large language models, like GPT-4, Alpaca, Llama etc), as it helps unify and standardize the developer experience in text embeddings, vector stores / databases (like Chroma), and chaining it for downstream applications through agents.
